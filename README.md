MATCH ODDS: Real Madrid 7/10, Draw 3/1, Arsenal 7/2.
THE Expert’s Pick: Arsenal are favorites to advance, but Real Madrid’s penchant for late-game heroics at the Bernabéu will mean this tie will not be over until the final whistle blows.
In brief: Arsenal head back across town for the second leg in the Bernabéu with a hefty, three–nil aggregate lead. Real Madrid, missing many of its best players, must pull off a historic turnaround to reach the semifinals.
